# NetworkLevelAnalysis_v1.0

forked from mwheelock/Network-Nevel-Analysis

This is a forked directory for the Network Level Analysis (NLA) Toolbox (Beta version). NLA is an extensible MATLAB-based software package for the analysis of behavioral associations with brain connectivity data. NLA utilizes a statistical approach known variously as 'pathway analysis','over representation analysis' or 'enrichment analysis', which was first used to describe behavioral or clinical associations in genome-wide association studies.

The team switched to developing a GUI version (currently in preparation).

I contributed a few functions for evaluation the network model and visualization which I found helpful while I was using the visualization functions in this toolbox.

#Example 1 
This concerns the plot of alternative brain system/networks sorting order for existing set of node/region of interests (ROIs) definitions. It calculates and displays the average silhouette index at the bottom to show the cluster quality of the existing system/networks definition provided by the user.
